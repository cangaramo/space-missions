# GraphQL with Express and Vue Apollo

Project consisted of:

**Creating an [GraphQL Server](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/running-an-express-graphql-server/)** using Node anad Express. We can use the GraphiQL tool on port 4000 to test GraphQL queries. We defined a schema using GraphQL schema language and we created new Object Types (Astronaut, Mission). Mutations and queries are handled by root resolvers.


**Creating the Vue app.** We'll use Apollo Client to fetch and modify data. In the app we'll be able to add our favourite astronauts and space missions.

## Run project

First we have to run the server:

```
node start.js
```

And then can run the Vue app:

```
npm install
```
```
npm run serve
```
